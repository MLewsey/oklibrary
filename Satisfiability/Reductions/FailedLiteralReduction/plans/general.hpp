  \brief Plans for the module FailedLiteralReduction


  The general case is handled in module KLevelForcedAssignments (see
  KLevelForcedAssignments/plans/general.hpp), while this module considers
  the case K=2 and extensions (with special algorithms etc.), including
  k=3.


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Foundations
  <ul>
   <li> Clarify the relations to modules
    <ul>
     <li> KLevelForcedAssignments: This module considers variations on K=2 and K=3,
     while KLevelForcedAssignments considers arbitrary K. </li>
     <li> Resolution </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> See the ComputerAlgebra-part. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Transferring the implementation used in OKsolver.


  \todo Timestamp
  <ul>
   <li> The (old) OKsolver used a timestamp
   (see OKlib/Programming/Utilities/TimeStamps/plans/general.hpp),
   incremented with each new literal processed
   (attempting to find a failed literal), which was used in two ways:
   <ol>
    <li> Assignments to variables used this timestamp, so that for a
    new round (with a new envisaged failed literal) assignments
    don't need to be undone). </li>
    <li> When processing literal x, all implied literals y where marked
    with the timestamp, so that when processing y, where meanwhile
    no failed literal has been detected, we know that we can skip y. </li>
   </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Avoiding repetition
  <ul>
   <li> If some reduction was performed, which other
   reductions have to be tested? </li>
   <li> While the timestamp trick uses forward-implications,
   here we need to trace implications backwards: We need to find out the clauses
   shortened by the performed reduction, and then we need to find all literals
   which imply the negations of the literals in those clauses --- those need to
   be (re)tested. Testing this could be expensive. </li>
   <li> In [Heule et al, SAT 2004] "tree-based look-ahead" needs investigation. </li>
  </ul>
   


  \todo Reduction uses already lazy datastructures, and we can also employ
  watched literals here (which are integrated into the occurrences lists).


  \todo Local learning
  <ul>
   <li> The cleanest way seems to me to handle all
   2-clauses separately, with a directed graph structure, and to maintain
   the invariant that this graph is a strict order (irreflexive and transitive),
   and for every arc x -> y we have also the arc -y -> -x. </li>
   <li> UCP then proceeds in stages: For envisaged failed literal x -> 1
   we obtain all derived unit clauses in one go and transfer them to the
   partial assignment, and then we perform the unit clause propagation;
   all unit clauses derived from >2-clauses must necessarily be new,
   we collect all of them, and go to the next stage etc. </li>
   <li> In [Bacchus, SAT 2003] HyperBinRes needs to be investigated. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Interface
  <ul>
   <li> Independent of the implementation, the interface should be that
   for each literal the list of "obtainable" implied other literals is available
   (this handles the 2-clauses and more) ---  either, as discussed before, all
   implications are explicitely stored, or they are computed. </li>
   <li> The two extremes are either only r_2, or with full local learning. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Graph representation
  <ul>
   <li> The known implications can be stored directly (as under local learning),
   which is fastest, but can use a lot of space, or we use further distributing
   levels (which can save considerable memory). </li>
   <li> The general problem is that of a given transitive relation R, where for each
   source we want to know all reachable sinks: This can be stored directly
   as a table, or we use intermediate steps (employing a directed graph).
   Perhaps such algorithms are used for database-implementations? </li>
  </ul>
   

  \todo Responsibility
  <ul>
   <li> Who is performing the r_2-reduction? </li>
   <li> One could imagine that every
   active clause-sets itself performs it, "flushing" at least when UCP has been
   completed the found unit clauses to the other active clause-sets --- but then
   each active clause-set had to know about the others. </li>
   <li> And since r_2-reduction
   is like branching ("more so" than just UCP), likely it is better that the alliance
   handles it: Choosing a literal for probing ("setting it to false"), performing UCP
   for the whole alliance where the active clause-sets are in probing mode, and
   performing the reduction if possible. </li>
   <li> This would also imply that the local learning
   is under the control of the alliance; seems to make good sense. (Alliances can
   themselves be considered as active clause-sets, and thus we also have the
   possibility to perform failed literal reduction in one active clause-set if we want.)
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo 2-clauses
  <ul>
   <li> Perhaps at least in the presence of a local-learning-facility in the alliance,
   the alliance members should hand over all 2-clauses to this facility?! </li>
   <li> Perhaps better not,
   since in general this cannot be done reasonably. </li>
   <li> Perhaps initially, when the alliance is
   set up, then the members have the possibility to hand over 2-clauses to the local
   learning facility (and getting rid off if themselves --- if they want), and later there
   might still be the possibility that if an alliance member detects a global 2-clause that
   it can be handed over to the local learning facility. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo There is the recurrent theme of "local vs. global": "Local" means relative to the
  current partial assignment, while "global" means relative to the initial (empty)
  partial assignment. There could be also forms in between, but they seem hard to handle.


  \todo Double look-ahead:
  What about the integration of partial double-look-ahead (partial r_3), as discussed
  for example in the SAT2007-paper by Heule/vanMaaren ? How much is missed with such a
  partial scheme? And what could be reasonable heuristics for the selection??
