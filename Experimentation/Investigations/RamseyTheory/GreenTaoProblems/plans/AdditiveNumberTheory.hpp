  \brief On investigations into additive number theory
  
  
  \todo The distribution of arithmetic progressions amongst primes
  <ul>
   <li> The task is to find a nice (thus very likely approximated) law for
   the values in the list ln_arithprog_primes_c(k,n) (see
   ComputerAlgebra/NumberTheory/Lisp/PrimeNumbers.mac) for fixed k >= 1. </li>
   <li> Ploted via %e.g.
   \verbatim
plot2d([discrete,create_list(i,i,1,1000),ln_arithprog_primes_c(3,1000)]);
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> For k = 1,2 this is trivial. </li>
   <li> For k >= 3 regression is to be performed; most powerful is using R,
   but for initial considerations also simple_linear_regression (use
   'load("stats")') can be used. </li>
   <li> There are role models for the regression function in the literature.
   </li>
   <li> One should also consider n_arithprog_primes_nc[k,n] (the non-cumulative
   data, i.e., as list the difference list of the above list). </li>
   <li> And one can consider the densities
   ln_arithprog_primes_c(k,n) / create_list(i,i,1,n). </li>
   <li> Hard to believe that there is nothing in the literature / on the
   Internet: We should enter for example ln_arithprog_primes_c(3,30) =
   [0,0,0,1,2,2,3,5,7,9,11,11,13,16,17,20,23,24,26,30,32,36,40,44,46,49,53,56,59,64]
   into that database of integer sequences and see whether there is information
   in it. </li>
   <li> Yes, this sequence is A125505 in
   http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/Seis.html. </li>
   <li> There it is only listed for n=64; this we can easily extend, and
   perhaps we should do so. </li>
   <li> And apparently for k >= 4 there is nothing entered there --- we
   should change this.
    <ol>
     <li> Say, up to k=10. </li>
     <li> For k=10 for example the first 315 values are 0, and then
     at least until index 3000 the value is constant 1; for such sequences
     we need a compressed representation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Of interest is also
   http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/Sindx_Pri.html#primes_AP
   which gives an overview. It contains for given k the smallest starting
   term, smallest difference and smallest end term for arithmetical
   progressions of primes of length k. However I do not understand
   these sequences (strange explanations). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Finding the first arithmetic progression
  <ul>
   <li> What seems very natural to me is k -> how many first primes are
   needed to get an progression of length k; this is greentao_1(k). </li>
   <li> See http://users.cybercity.dk/~dsl522332/math/aprecords.htm for
   current information around this subject; the related sequence is (now
   showing p_i instead of i):
   \verbatim
L : [
2, 3, 7, 23, 29, 157, 907, 1669, 1879, 2089, 
249037, 262897, 725663, 36850999, 173471351, 198793279, 4827507229, 17010526363, 83547839407, 572945039351,
6269243827111
];
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> This is available as A005115. </li>
   <li> From this sequence S via map(rank_primes,S) we obtain the sequence:
   \verbatim
for p in L do print(rank_primes(p));
1,2,4,9,10,37,155,263,289,316,
21966,23060,58464,2253121,9686320,11015837,227225515,755752809,3466256932,22009064470,
220525414079
   \endverbatim
   where starting with k=12 actually "RankPrimes" was used. </li>
   <li> Plot the data (using R) suggests that (log,log(log))-transformation
   for (x,y) might be appropriate (that is, a model y = exp(a * x^b)):
   \verbatim
y = c(4,9,10,37,155,263,289,316,21966,23060,58464,2253121,9686320,11015837,227225515,755752809,3466256932,22009064470,220525414079)
x = 3:21
plot(log(x),log(log(y)))

m0 = lm(log(log(y)) ~ log(x))

   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo The first arithmetic progression allowing a missing number
  <ul>
   <li> greentao_2(2,k) has still a "mostly number theoretical touch". </li>
   <li> greentao_2(2,0) = 0, greentao_2(2,1) = 2, greentao(2,2) = 3. </li>
   <li> greentao_2(2,3) = 7. </li>
   <li> greentao_2(2,4) = 14. </li>
   <li> greentao_2(2,5) = 31. </li>
   <li> This sequence is apparently not in that "online encyclopedia" (also
   not after applying unrank_primes to it, obtaining [3,5,17,43,127]). </li>
  </ul>
